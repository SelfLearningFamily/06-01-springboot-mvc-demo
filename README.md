# 06-01-springboot-mvc-demo

In this project, I will do the coding to give a brief overview of Springboot MVC. The previous series I have compiled so far was primarily focused on Rest Apis (project 01-05).
But in this project for covering all the aspects of MVC i.e. Model, View, And Controller, I'll be using HTML pages as View. This is a pretty basic project so I'll add the whole project in a single commit. And will explain the points in the commit details if something requires more explanation. I'll add two projects for spring-mvc. in the first i.e. 06-01-... I'll cover the basic flow of MVC. and in the second project i.e. 06-02... I'll try to cover the different validation methods. So if you are not interested in HTML-related tasks, you can skip this '06' project altogether.
