# 06-01-springboot-mvc-demo

In this projectm, I am going to do the coding to gives the brief overview of Springboot MVC. The previous series that I have compiled so far, was primarilary focused on Rest Apis (project 01-05).
But in this project for covering all the aspect of MVC i.e. Model, View And Controller, I ll be using html pages as View. This is a pretty basic project so I ll add the whole project in a single commit. And will explain the points in the commit details if I think somthing would require more explanation. I ll add two projects for spring-mvc. in the first i.e. 06-01-... I ll cover the basic flow of MVC. and in the second project i.e 06-02... I 'll try to cover the different validation methods. So if you are not interested in HTML related tasks, you can skip this '06' project all together.
